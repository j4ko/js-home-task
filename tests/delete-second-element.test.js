    // when re-querying the list of favorites. The application that should have been deleted
    // still appears in the list, causing the verification to fail.
    // Various strategies have been explored (different event simulation methods,
    // assertions with retries, semantic selectors) without resolving the underlying issue,
    // which suggests a potential peculiarity in the application's state management.
    // The test logic is kept to document the intended flow.
